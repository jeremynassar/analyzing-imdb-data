For this project I was tasked with provisioning a spark cluster using amazon web services. Using AWS, I used EMR to load and run some analysis on a IMDB’s dataset. Which you can find on Kaggle. For my analysis, I used Juptyer notebook to run my analysis . I also used a public S3 bucket to get this data for our analysis.
